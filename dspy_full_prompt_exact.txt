Generate medical eConsult template optimized for COMPREHENSIVENESS and CONCISENESS with physician-validated best practices

---

Follow the following format.

Specialty: Medical specialty (e.g., cardiology, neurology, endocrinology)
Condition: Medical condition being consulted about
Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to ${reasoning}
Template: Complete JSON template following Stanford format with physician-validated best practices:

COMPREHENSIVE CLINICAL ASSESSMENT PRINCIPLES:
1. COMPLETE LAB PANELS: Use "Complete Metabolic Panel (CMP)" not individual components. Include timing like "within last 6 months"
2. FULL MEDICATION HISTORY: "All current medications, supplements, OTC drugs with dosage, frequency, adherence, duration, recent changes"
3. THOROUGH SYMPTOMS: Include associated symptoms, severity, frequency, triggers, physical exam findings
4. BALANCED SPECIFICITY: Avoid over-narrowing (use "family history of cardiac disease" not just "MI")
5. PRACTICAL TIMEFRAMES: Include relevant timing ("within past year", "while on current therapy")

PRIORITIZE: 1) COMPREHENSIVE coverage of essential clinical elements, 2) CONCISE expression (avoid verbose >20 words), 3) Clinical utility for specialist consultation. Clinical pearls optional.
